## Why this lesson?
Diversification can become a trap:
- either you don't do enough (everything on 1 idea),
- or you scatter (20 ETFs) without understanding.

This lesson gives you a simple method: **diversify by axes**.

---

## 1) Diversifying ≠ multiplying lines
Having 20 lines doesn't mean you're diversified.
If those lines contain the same "giants," you're concentrated without seeing it.

---

## 2) The 4 useful axes (beginner)
### Axis A — Geography
Canada / USA / Europe / emerging markets…

### Axis B — Sectors
Technology, finance, healthcare, industrials, energy…

### Axis C — Size
- large caps
- mid caps
- small caps

### Axis D — Style
- "value" (lower valuation)
- "growth" (expected growth)

You don't need to optimize these axes to the millimeter.
You need to **see if you're "all in the same corner."**

---

## 3) Concentration risk: simple to explain
If one company/sector makes up a huge share of your portfolio:
- your portfolio depends on a single scenario.

Concentration can be intentional (conviction), but for a beginner:
- it's better to understand the consequences first.

---

## 4) Limpid method: 3 "anti-fog" questions
1) What are my **top 3 countries**?
2) What are my **top 3 sectors**?
3) What share of my portfolio depends on the **top 10 positions**?

If you can't answer, the portfolio is "opaque."

---

## 5) In Limpid
- Country/sector exposure map
- "Top 10 > X%" alert
- "ETF overlap" detection

---

## Key takeaways
- Diversify = reduce dependence on a single scenario.
- 4 axes: country, sector, size, style.
- The goal: understand, not hyper-optimize.

---

## Mini-exercise
Look at your exposure map (sandbox).
If 1 sector > 35%, explain in one sentence what that implies.
