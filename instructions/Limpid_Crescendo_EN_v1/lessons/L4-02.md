## Why this lesson?
Many beginners think "investing" = the product (ETF/stock).
But the **account type** (the wrapper) changes:
- taxation,
- sometimes withdrawal rules,
- and therefore the strategy.

This lesson stays **educational** (not tax advice).

---

## 1) Account type = container, not content
An account type (TFSA/RRSP…) is a framework.
Inside, you can hold:
- ETFs, stocks, bonds, etc.

---

## 2) General logic (without details that change)
### TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account — CELI in French)
- Often used for: flexibility, various goals.
- Educational advantage: gains are not taxed (subject to rules).
- Withdrawals: generally more flexible (verify current rules).

### RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan — REER in French)
- Often associated with long-term / retirement.
- Logic: deduction/tax deferral (subject to rules).
- Withdrawals: more "structured" depending on the case.

### FHSA (First Home Savings Account — CELIAPP in French)
- Goal: first home purchase (specific structure).
- Treat it as a "specific goal" account.

### RESP (Registered Education Savings Plan — REEE in French)
- Goal: children's education, with incentive mechanisms according to the rules.

## 3) Pedagogical decision tree (simplified)
1) Is my goal **housing** (first property)?
→ look into the dedicated account (if applicable)

2) Is my goal **retirement/long term**?
→ a long-term account (e.g. RRSP) may make sense

3) Is my goal **flexible/mixed**?
→ a flexible account (e.g. TFSA) can be a good starting point

4) If I have a tax advisor / complex situation:
→ verify with official sources / a professional

The idea: match "account" ↔ "goal," not "account" ↔ "trend."

## 4) In Limpid
- During onboarding, you choose a goal → Limpid suggests an account type "to explore" (educational).
- Lessons show you examples, not prescriptions.
- Links to "official sources."

---

## Key takeaways
- Account type ≠ product.
- The account type follows the goal.
- Stay factual and verify when it matters.

---

## Mini-exercise
Pick a goal: (a) 2-year project, (b) retirement, (c) first home.
For each, note which account type you'd explore first, and why.
