## Why this lesson?
Many beginners say:
- "I made $500"
but don't know if that's:
- a gain "on paper,"
- or a gain actually pocketed,
- or a gain before fees/taxes.

This lesson teaches you to speak the language of your portfolio.

---

## 1) Realized vs. unrealized (paper gains)
- **Unrealized gain**: your position is worth more today, but you haven't sold.
- **Realized gain**: you sold (fully or partially) and locked in the gain/loss.

**Why it matters:**
- Psychologically: you might panic over a drop in an unrealized gain.
- Tax-wise: usually, rules mainly apply to realized gains (depending on account/country).

---

## 2) Cost basis (average cost)
When you buy the same asset multiple times, your "purchase price" isn't a single point.

You typically have a **weighted average cost**.

Example (gentle math):
- Purchase 1: 1 share at $100
- Purchase 2: 1 share at $120
Average cost ≈ (100 + 120) / 2 = $110

If the current price is $115:
- unrealized gain ≈ $5 per share.

---

## 3) Return vs. dollar gain: two views
- In dollars: useful for your goal (e.g. "I'm up $500")
- In %: useful for comparison ("+5%")

You need both, but not for the same questions.

---

## 4) Common mistakes
- Confusing "total value" with "profit."
- Forgetting fees (trading/FX/MER) in your mental estimate.
- Comparing yourself to someone else with a different time horizon.

---

## 5) In Limpid
- Table: realized / unrealized
- Calculated average cost
- "Explanation" when you click a metric

---

## Key takeaways
- Unrealized = on paper.
- Realized = concrete.
- Average cost = the basis for calculations.
- $ vs. % = two different purposes.

---

## Mini-exercise
Take a hypothetical position.
Explain in 2 sentences the difference between "unrealized gain" and "realized gain."
