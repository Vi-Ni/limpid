## Why this lesson?
Many people search for "the best ETF."
But most of the time, what explains a portfolio's behavior is:
> **the split across major categories (asset allocation)**.

---

## 1) Allocation: "how much in each engine"
Allocation = distributing across:
- stocks
- bonds
- cash (and sometimes real estate/alternatives)

### Pedagogical example
- Portfolio A: 100% stocks
- Portfolio B: 60% stocks / 40% bonds
- Portfolio C: 40% stocks / 60% bonds

They can all contain "good products" but experience very different years.

---

## 2) How to choose without magic: goal + horizon + risk
- Long horizon + high tolerance → more stocks (often).
- Short horizon + need for stability → more cash/bonds (often).
- Specific project (2–3 years) → caution with volatility.

**Important:**
It's not "stocks = good, bonds = bad."
It's "coherence."

---

## 3) Stability has a cost (and that's normal)
A more stable portfolio usually has:
- less variation,
- and often less potential return.

That's a deliberate trade-off, not a mistake.

---

## 4) In Limpid
- Your profile (RiskBand) determines a **range** of pedagogical allocations.
- You can simulate 3 allocations and see:
  - behavior in a downturn scenario,
  - behavior if rates rise,
  - impact on progress toward your goal.

---

## Key takeaways
- Allocation = lever #1 of a portfolio.
- It depends on your goal, horizon, and risk.
- A "stable" trade-off is a decision, not a failure.

---

## Mini-exercise
In the sandbox, try 3 allocations (80/20, 60/40, 40/60) and observe:
- which moves the most,
- which feels "livable" to you emotionally.
