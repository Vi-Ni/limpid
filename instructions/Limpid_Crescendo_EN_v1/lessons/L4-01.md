## Why this lesson?
Fees aren't just one number. They come from several places:
- fund fees (MER),
- currency conversion fees (FX),
- spreads (bid-ask gap),
- taxes (depending on account type).

If you only see one of these, you don't have a "limpid" picture.

---

## 1) MER: annual fund fees
Already covered: an annual % built into the fund.

---

## 2) FX: the cost (and risk) of converting
Two dimensions:
- **cost** of conversion (fees/markup),
- **risk** of currency fluctuation (CAD/USD/EUR).

Even if you don't convert manually, if your ETF holds foreign assets,
you may face currency risk (depending on the structure).

---

## 3) Spread: the gap between buy and sell prices
When you buy/sell, there's usually:
- a "buy" price slightly higher,
- a "sell" price slightly lower.

On liquid products, the spread is often small.
On others, it can be significant.

---

## 4) Taxes (very simplified)
- Taxes depend on:
  - the account type (e.g. TFSA vs. taxable account),
  - the type of income (interest/dividends/capital gains),
  - your personal situation.

Limpid stays educational:
- explain the principle,
- point to official sources,
without giving personalized tax advice.

---

## 5) In Limpid: "total estimated cost"
UX goal:
- display what is known,
- display what is uncertain (e.g. average spreads),
- display the date/source.

---

## Key takeaways
- Total cost = MER + FX + spreads + taxes (depending on the case).
- "Small" percentages repeated over years add up significantly.

---

## Mini-exercise
On a hypothetical ETF:
- MER = 0.80%
- Estimated FX = 0.20%
Estimate the annual cost on $10,000 (approx.).
