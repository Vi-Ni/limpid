## Why this lesson?
The #1 problem for beginners isn't a lack of intelligence:
it's the **stress** of facing drops.

To decide "mindfully," you need to understand:
- what drops mean (and don't mean),
- how your brain interprets risk.

---

## 1) Volatility: the amplitude of movements
Volatility means "it moves a lot."

- A stock can do +8%, then -6%, then +4%.
- A diversified portfolio also moves, but often less.

**Important:**
High volatility doesn't mean "bad," but it does mean:
- a harder emotional experience,
- risk of selling at the worst moment.

---

## 2) Drawdown: the drop from a peak
Drawdown is the fall between:
- your highest point (peak),
- and a lower point.

Example:
- you rise to $10,000
- you drop to $8,000
Drawdown = -20%

This measure is often more intuitive than "volatility."

---

## 3) The brain trap: loss aversion
The brain feels a loss more strongly than a gain of the same amount.
Result:
- you might sell to "stop the pain,"
- even if your plan's horizon is long.

The goal isn't to "feel nothing."
The goal is to **anticipate** your reaction and set up guardrails.

---

## 4) Two simple guardrails
1) **Written plan**: "if -20% then I…" (don't improvise)
2) **Rebalancing through contributions**: simple action, no drama

---

## 5) In Limpid
- Scenario Lab: "what if -20%"
- Journal: note "how I'm feeling"
- Alerts: "your concentration increases your potential drawdown"

---

## Key takeaways
- Volatility = it moves.
- Drawdown = drop from a peak.
- Drops are normal; what matters is your plan.
