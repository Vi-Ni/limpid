## Why this lesson?
Many beginners think:
- "I don't want to pick individual stocks" → "So I'll buy an ETF."

That's often a good intuition, but you need to understand:
- what an ETF contains,
- what it costs,
- and what it doesn't guarantee.

---

## 1) ETF: a basket of assets
An ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) holds a **basket**:
- stocks (e.g. "global"),
- bonds,
- sometimes a theme (technology, climate, etc.).

### The promise
> "You buy one line, you get diversification."

This reduces the risk of "one company fails," but not the risk of "the market drops."

---

## 2) Index vs. active management
- Index ETF: tracks an index (e.g. "global market").
- Active fund: a manager picks the holdings.

**The beginner's point:**
- The important thing isn't to "guess the best one."
- The important thing is to understand your exposure (countries/sectors/currency) and your fees.

---

## 3) MER: the operating cost
The **MER** (Management Expense Ratio) is an annual % charged by the fund.

- 0.20% means ~$20/year on $10,000 (approx.).
- It's not billed as an "invoice": it's built into the fund.

**Key idea:**
> Low MER doesn't mean "best," but high MER needs to be justified.

---

## 4) "Look-through": what you actually own
A "global" ETF can contain hundreds of companies.
But often the top 10 positions represent a large share.

**Example:**
You think you have "the world."
In practice, you may be heavily exposed to large US companies.

That's why a tool like Limpide matters:
- "Top holdings"
- "Dominant sectors"
- "Overlaps between ETFs"

---

## 5) Limits of an ETF
- If the overall market drops, the ETF drops.
- Some "thematic" ETFs are concentrated.
- Holdings may be published with a delay (monthly/quarterly).

---

## 6) In Limpide
- ETF fact sheet: MER, top holdings, sectors, countries, currency.
- Overlap detection: "you have 3 ETFs holding the same heavyweights."
- Simple explanation of the tracked index.

---

## Key takeaways
- ETF = easy diversification, but not "risk-free."
- MER = recurring cost.
- Transparency = knowing your real exposure.

---

## Mini-exercise
Pick two hypothetical ETFs:
- ETF A: "Global"
- ETF B: "Technology"
Compare 3 things: (1) diversification, (2) concentration, (3) fees.
