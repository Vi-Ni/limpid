## Why this lesson?
You want to invest "mindfully."
That starts with one sentence:
> **I know what I own.**

But in reality:
- an ETF can have 500 holdings,
- holdings can change,
- data can be delayed.

This lesson teaches you to aim for **honest** transparency: clear, sourced, dated, and humble.

---

## 1) Holdings: level 1 of transparency
If you hold a stock:
- transparency is direct (you own the company).

If you hold an ETF:
- you own a basket → transparency via holdings.

---

## 2) Look-through: level 2 (and the most useful)
"Look-through" means:
- you translate your ETFs into real exposures.

Example:
- Global ETF + Tech ETF + S&P 500 ETF
You might think you're "super diversified."
With look-through, you may discover:
- massive concentration on the same companies.

---

## 3) Overlaps: why they're common
Major indices overlap.
If you stack popular ETFs, you can end up with:
- more complexity,
- without real diversification.

---

## 4) Limits & data honesty
- Holdings are sometimes published with a delay.
- Methodologies differ across sources.
- Some exposures are estimated.

**Limpide's position:**
- display the source,
- display the date,
- display "uncertain/estimated" when needed.

---

## 5) In Limpide
- "Real" exposure map
- "Top common holdings" overlaps
- "Data as of …" badge
- "Why is this an estimate?" button

---

## Key takeaways
- Transparency = holdings + look-through + overlaps.
- Transparency without a date/source isn't reliable.
- "I don't know" displayed clearly is better than a false score.

---

## Mini-exercise
In a hypothetical portfolio with 2 ETFs, spot:
- 1 holding present in both
- the total share of that holding (combined).
