## Why this lesson?
Even with good products, a portfolio can drift:
- one region (e.g. USA) rises more → it takes up too much space,
- a currency moves,
- you add money over time.

This lesson gives you 3 simple tools:
1) understand currency,
2) invest regularly (DCA),
3) rebalance.

---

## 1) Currency (FX): you can gain/lose "even if the asset doesn't move"
If you buy a USD-denominated asset from a CAD portfolio:
- if USD rises vs. CAD, your CAD value can go up even if the asset doesn't move.
- if USD drops vs. CAD, the opposite can happen.

**Intuition:**
> You have a double bet: the asset + the currency.

You don't need to be an FX expert, but you need to know **whether currency affects you**.

---

## 2) DCA: invest regularly to smooth your entry
DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging — investing a fixed amount at regular intervals) isn't a guarantee of gain,
but it's a behavioral strategy:
- you invest when it's up **and** when it's down,
- you reduce the pressure of "finding the right moment."

---

## 3) Rebalancing: getting back to your plan
Rebalancing = bringing the allocation back to the target (e.g. 60/40).

Two approaches:
- sell some of what's grown too much (more advanced),
- or simpler: **direct your new contributions** to what's "fallen behind."

**Benefit:**
- discipline,
- risk management,
- avoiding "accidental" portfolios.

## 4) In Limpide
- Currency map: % CAD / USD / EUR
- Drift alerts: "target allocation vs. current"
- Simulated rebalancing: pedagogical suggestions (no buy orders)

---

## Key takeaways
- Currency can affect your result.
- DCA = reduce the stress of timing.
- Rebalancing = keep your risk under control.

## Mini-exercise
In the sandbox:
- set a target of 60/40
- run a scenario "stocks +20%"
- observe the drift and test a "contribution-based" rebalancing.
