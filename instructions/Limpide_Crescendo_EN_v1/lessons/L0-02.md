## Why this lesson?
Two invisible forces drive a large part of your results:
1) **time** (compound interest),
2) **erosion** (inflation + fees).

Beginners focus on "which product to pick," when **duration + fees** can matter far more.

---

## 1) Inflation: your money "loses power" if you do nothing
Inflation is the general rise in prices.
If prices go up, $100 today won't buy the same thing in 10 years.

**Consequence:**
- If your savings earn nothing (or too little), you can "lose" purchasing power even if your balance goes up slightly.

---

## 2) Compound interest: "interest on interest"
Compound interest is a snowball effect:
- year 1: you earn on your capital
- year 2: you earn on (capital + gains)
- etc.

### Simple example (gentle math)
You invest **$1,000** at **6%** per year (pedagogical approximation).

- After 1 year: 1,000 × 1.06 = **$1,060**
- After 2 years: 1,060 × 1.06 = **$1,123.60**
- After 10 years: the effect becomes much more visible.

It's not magic: it's just time doing its work.

---

## 3) CAGR: the "average annual rate" (useful for comparing)
**CAGR** (Compound Annual Growth Rate) answers:
> "What constant annual rate would have produced the same final result?"

Formula (optional):
- CAGR ≈ (Final Value / Initial Value)^(1/n) − 1

You don't need to memorize it.
The idea: **compare different periods** with an "equivalent" rate.

---

## 4) Fees: the silent parasite
Fees (MER, management fees, FX, etc.) "eat away" at compound interest.

### Pedagogical example
Imagine:
- Portfolio: $10,000
- Gross return: 6%/year
- Fees: 1%/year

Net return approx.: **5%/year**.

Over 1 year, the difference seems small.
Over 10–20 years, **it becomes enormous**.

**Key idea:**
> Fees are not "a detail." They're percentages that repeat every year.

---

## 5) In Limpide: how you see this
- A "**Total estimated cost**" panel (MER + FX + spreads if known).
- A simulator: "Over 20 years, how much does 1% in fees cost me?" (educational).
- "High fees vs. alternatives" alerts (without recommending a product).

---

## Key takeaways
- Inflation = your cash loses purchasing power.
- Compound interest = time can become your best ally.
- Fees = the silent enemy of the long term.
- CAGR = a simple tool for comparison.

## Mini-exercise
If you had $10,000 and were choosing between 0.25% and 1.25% in annual fees, would you think "it's about the same"?
(Write down your answer, then revisit it after the fees lesson.)
