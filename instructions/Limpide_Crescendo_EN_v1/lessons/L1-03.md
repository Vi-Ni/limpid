## Why this lesson?
You're bound to hear about crypto.
The goal here isn't to tell you whether to buy it, but to understand:
- why it's not the same as a stock or a bond,
- what risks are specific to it.

---

## 1) Fundamental difference: not a company, not a loan
- A **stock** represents a piece of a company (with activity, revenue, etc.).
- A **bond** is a loan (with interest).
- A **crypto** is a digital asset whose value largely depends on:
  - adoption,
  - confidence,
  - liquidity,
  - and the regulatory framework.

There may be utility (network, protocol), but the valuation approach is different.

---

## 2) Specific risks (to be aware of)
### High volatility
Price swings can be very large in very short periods.

### Custody risk
If you self-custody:
- losing your key = potentially irreversible loss.
If you use a platform:
- risk of bankruptcy, freezing, hacking (depending on the case).

### Regulatory risk
Rules can change, affecting access, taxation, and liquidity.

### Fraud and ecosystem risk
The ecosystem has more bad actors (memes, scams) than traditional markets.

---

## 3) Where it fits in a "mental map"
Crypto is often closer to:
- "speculative/alternative asset"
than a standard "portfolio engine."

If you're starting out, the most important thing is to master:
- goals, time horizon, diversification, fees,
before adding a highly volatile asset.

---

## 4) In Limpide (stance)
- Limpide can show you **exposure**, **volatility**, **custody risk**, **sources**,
but without pushing you toward a decision.
- If you enable the "crypto" option, you'll see educational warnings.

---

## Key takeaways
- Crypto ≠ stock ≠ bond.
- Risks: volatility + custody + regulation + fraud.
- Start by mastering the basics, then explore.

## Mini-exercise
Write 2 reasons "why it could go up" and 2 reasons "why it could go down," without using the word "hype."
