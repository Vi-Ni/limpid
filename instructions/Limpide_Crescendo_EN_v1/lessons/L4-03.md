## Why this lesson?
The financial world is full of documents.
The goal isn't to read everything like an expert.
The goal is to know:
- what to look at first,
- what questions to ask.

---

## 1) The "3-layer" method
### Layer 1 (30 seconds): key facts
- fund/investment objective
- fees (MER/management)
- main exposures (countries/sectors)
- key risks

### Layer 2 (5 minutes): what you actually understand
- top holdings / allocation
- track record (with caution)
- distribution policy (dividends)

### Layer 3 (if needed): details
- indexing methods, derivatives (if mentioned), etc.

---

## 2) Simple questions to ask (worth their weight in gold)
1) **What does it actually hold?**
2) **What does it really cost?**
3) **In what scenario do I lose?**
4) **How liquid is it?**
5) **What are the sources, and as of what date?**

---

## 3) In Limpide
- Every fact sheet has a "Sources & date" block.
- You can follow a checklist.
- Goal: turn "intimidating document" into "digestible information."

---

## Key takeaways
- Reading ≠ understanding everything at once.
- 3-layer method.
- Always: holdings, fees, risks, liquidity, sources.

## Mini-exercise
