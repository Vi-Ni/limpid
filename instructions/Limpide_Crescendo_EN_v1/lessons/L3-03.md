## Why this lesson?
Many tools try to "predict the market."
Limpide doesn't do that.

We do something better for a beginner:
> **scenarios** to understand your portfolio's sensitivity.

---

## 1) Scenario ≠ prediction
A scenario is a question:
- "What happens if…?"

You're not trying to guess.
You're preparing.

---

## 2) The 3 MVP scenarios (simple but powerful)
### A) Stock market drop
"What if stocks fall -20%"
→ you see the impact based on your allocation.

### B) Currency movement (CAD/USD)
"What if CAD strengthens 10% vs. USD"
→ you see the impact on your USD positions.

### C) Rate shock (bonds)
"What if rates rise quickly"
→ simplified: bonds can drop (in price), especially those with long duration.

These are educational versions, not trading models.

---

## 3) How to read a scenario result
- It's not "this will happen."
- It's "if this happens, here's what I feel / what it does to my goal."

Two portfolios can have the same average performance,
but very different scenario outcomes.

---

## 4) In Limpide
- You pick a scenario.
- You see: value, allocation, and explanatory text ("why it moves").
- You can test a simulated rebalancing.

---

## Key takeaways
- Scenarios = preparation, not prediction.
- 3 axes: market, currency, rates.
- You learn to decide with less panic.

---

## Mini-exercise
Run a "stocks -20%" scenario.
Write: "What bothers me the most is ____ (drop, duration, goal impact, etc.)."
