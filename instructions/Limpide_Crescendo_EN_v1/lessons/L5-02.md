## Why this lesson?
You want to know "where your money goes, what it does, its ethics, etc."
That's exactly the most exciting part… and the most complex.

There is no ONE perfect measure.
There are:
- angles,
- sources,
- disagreements.

**Limpide's position:**
- neutral on the facts,
- committed to the method: "evidence first."

---

## 1) ESG ≠ impact (simplified)
### ESG (often)
Measures how a company manages certain issues:
- environmental,
- social,
- governance.

It can mean "better managed" without necessarily "creating a direct positive impact."

### Impact (in the strong sense)
An "impact" investment aims for:
- intention to produce positive impact,
- measurable impact,
- alongside financial return.

## 2) Why scores can diverge
Two providers can score differently because they:
- weight criteria differently,
- have different data,
- use different metrics.

So, "ESG score = 78" is not an absolute truth.

---

## 3) Limpide method: 3 layers of ethics
1) **Facts**: sector, activities, revenue, sourced controversies
2) **Rules**: exclusions (weapons, tobacco…), preferences (climate, housing…)
3) **Context**: "trade-offs" (e.g. diversification vs. strict exclusion)

---

## 4) Greenwashing: 6 warning signs (educational)
1) Lots of marketing, little data.
2) No clear methodology ("we're green").
3) "Impact" not measured, no indicators.
4) Name change (rebranding) without real change.
5) Undated information.
6) No verifiable sources.

---

## 5) In Limpide
- Multiple angles (e.g. 2–3 tags/methods) rather than a single score.
- "Sources & dates" block.
- "Why we don't have a single answer" explained clearly.

---

## Key takeaways
- ESG = risk/opportunity management; Impact = intention + measurement.
- Diverging scores = normal.
- Method: facts + rules + trade-offs, with sources.

---

## Mini-exercise
Pick a value important to you (e.g. local agriculture).
Note:
- what fact would prove the impact is real,
- what data point would make you doubt.
