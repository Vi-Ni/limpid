## Why this lesson?
When you're starting out, you often think "investing" = "picking a good product."
In reality, **the key is understanding the framework**: *why you're investing, when you'll need the money, and how much uncertainty you can handle*.

This lesson gives you a **simple mental map** that you'll use everywhere in Limpide.

## 1) Investing means solving a problem (not "beating the market")
Before talking about the stock market, ETFs, ethics, etc., let's start with one sentence:

> **"I want to reach X, by Y, while accepting Z amount of uncertainty."**

- **X = goal**: a purchase, a project, retirement, independence, etc.
- **Y = time horizon**: 6 months, 3 years, 15 years…
- **Z = acceptable uncertainty**: both your ability *and* your willingness to see your portfolio drop.

If X or Y are vague, you can't judge whether an investment "makes sense."

---

## 2) The triad: Return — Risk — Time Horizon
### Return
**Return** is what you gain (or lose) over a period.

- Example: $1,000 → $1,100 in one year = **+10%** (before fees and taxes).
- Returns can be **positive** or **negative**.

### Risk
**Risk** isn't just about "losing."
It's mainly about: **uncertainty** (outcomes can vary wildly depending on timing).

- An asset can be "great over 10 years" but very painful over 6 months.
- Risk has many faces: volatility, liquidity, default, currency, concentration…

### Time Horizon
Your **time horizon** is: *how long you can leave your money invested without touching it*.

- With a short horizon, a drop can become a real problem.
- With a long horizon, short-term swings matter less, **but** they still exist.

**Key idea:**
> The more return you aim for, the more uncertainty you accept.
> And the longer your horizon, the more you can "absorb" temporary drops.

## 3) Capacity vs. tolerance: two concepts beginners mix up
### Risk capacity (factual)
Your capacity depends on your situation:
- stable income or not,
- debts,
- emergency savings,
- essential expenses,
- dependents, etc.

If you have no financial cushion, your portfolio shouldn't put you at risk.

### Risk tolerance (psychological)
This is your emotional reaction:
- "If it drops -20%, do I panic?"
- "Can I sleep at night?"

You can have high capacity but low tolerance (or the opposite).

---

## 4) Diversification: the beginner's "bumper"
**Diversifying** means reducing dependence on a single scenario.

- Don't put everything in 1 company.
- Don't put everything in 1 country.
- Don't put everything in 1 sector.
- Don't put everything in 1 currency.

Diversification doesn't eliminate drops, but it prevents you from "betting your life" on a single outcome.

---

## 5) In Limpide: how this mental map is used
- **Onboarding**: you define X, Y, Z (goal, horizon, risk).
- **Scenario Lab**: Limpide shows you "what if -20%" or "what if CAD drops" — what changes.
- **Clarity Score**: you progress when you understand and when your portfolio becomes more coherent.

---

## Key takeaways (in 30 seconds)
- Investing = **goal + time horizon + risk**.
- Risk = **uncertainty**, not just loss.
- Capacity (facts) ≠ tolerance (emotions).
- Diversification = bumper.

---

## Mini-exercise (2 minutes)
1) Write a sentence: "I want ___ by ___, and I can accept ___."
2) Rate your tolerance from 1 to 5 if your portfolio dropped -20% over 12 months.
