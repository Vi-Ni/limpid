## Why this lesson?
You want to highlight what many overlook:
> investing isn't limited to the stock market.

There are ways to fund:
- local projects,
- cooperatives,
- farmland,
with a return… but also different risks.

---

## 1) 3 broad families of local impact (educational)
### A) Community bonds
You lend to a local organization/project:
- defined rate + term,
- concrete goal (housing, social, etc.)

**Risks:**
- default,
- limited liquidity (hard to resell),
- dependence on the issuer.

### B) Cooperatives / local structures
Sometimes via equity shares, bonds, or dedicated vehicles.

**Risks:**
- liquidity,
- governance,
- local concentration.

### C) Farmland / agricultural land
Different models exist (depending on the country):
- direct purchase,
- trusts / collective structures,
- specialized funds.

**Risks:**
- illiquidity (money locked up longer),
- less "daily" valuation (no instant price),
- operational risk (management, legal framework).

---

## 2) Why it's "powerful" (and why it's demanding)
Powerful because:
- you know where the money goes,
- you can support a local mission.

Demanding because:
- information is less standardized than an ETF,
- liquidity is lower,
- analysis relies on documents + trust in governance.

---

## 3) Simple strategy: 'core + satellites'
To balance:
- diversification (safety),
- local impact (purpose),

you can think in 2 blocks:
- **Core**: diversified portfolio (often via broad ETFs) → structural stability
- **Satellites**: small local pockets → impact + learning

Limpide doesn't recommend a specific %, but helps you:
- visualize concentration,
- measure liquidity,
- understand the scenarios.

---

## 4) Due diligence checklist (beginner version)
1) What will the money be used for?
2) What's the duration? How do I get my money back?
3) What return? What could prevent it?
4) Who governs? Financial transparency?
5) What guarantees? What repayment track record?
6) What sources? Date? Documents?

---

## 5) Appendix (France/Brittany later)
Crowdfunding mechanisms also exist, but:
- different regulatory framework,
- different platforms,
- different taxation.

Limpide may have a "France mode" later,
but the analysis logic remains the same: transparency + sources + risks + liquidity.

---

## Key takeaways
- Local impact = often less liquid, more "real," more demanding.
- The core + satellites strategy is intuitive.
- Always: goal, duration, risk, governance, sources.

---

## Mini-exercise
Pick a hypothetical project: "buying land for farmers."
Answer 3 questions:
- how long is the money locked up?
- what's the main risk?
- what proof of impact should you demand?
