## Why this lesson?
You'll hear phrases like:
- "Stocks are risky"
- "Bonds are safe"
- "Cash is conservative"

Sometimes true, sometimes not.
This lesson gives you an intuition: **how each engine works**.

---

## 1) Stocks: you own a piece of a company
When you buy a stock, you own a small piece of a company.

**How it can gain:**
- If the company grows, investors are willing to pay more.
- Sometimes through **dividends** (a share of profits distributed).

**How it can lose:**
- If the company disappoints (falling profits, scandal, competition…)
- If the sector or economy suffers.

**Dominant risk:**
- Large swings (volatility).
- Specific risk (one company can do very badly).

---

## 2) Bonds: you lend money
A bond is a loan (to a government, a city, a company…).

You typically receive:
- **interest** (coupon),
- and repayment of the principal at maturity (depending on the type).

**How it can gain:**
- Through regular interest payments.
- Sometimes through resale (if its value rises).

**How it can lose:**
- **Interest rate risk**: if rates rise, older bonds with lower rates become less attractive → their price drops.
- **Credit/default risk**: the borrower may pay late, or not pay at all.

**Intuition:**
> Bonds "move" too. They're often less volatile than stocks, but they're not immobile.

---

## 3) Cash & equivalents (savings, money market)
Cash (or equivalents) aims for:
- stability,
- liquidity (ability to withdraw),
- often lower return (but depends on current rates).

**The real risk of cash:**
- inflation (purchasing power),
- sometimes the temptation to "wait too long" and never invest.

---

## 4) Why we mix them: balance
A portfolio doesn't have to be 100% stocks.
We mix:
- stocks (potential growth),
- bonds (relative stability),
- cash (liquidity / shock absorber).

The mix depends on:
- your time horizon,
- your goal,
- your acceptable risk.

---

## 5) In Limpide
- "Allocation" view: stocks/bonds/cash.
- Scenarios: "if rates rise" (bonds) vs. "if markets drop" (stocks).
- Built-in explanations for each category.

---

## Key takeaways
- Stocks: ownership, more volatility.
- Bonds: lending, sensitive to rates and credit.
- Cash: stable, but inflation exists.
- A portfolio = a coherent mix, not an opinion.

## Mini-exercise
In a hypothetical 60/40 portfolio (60% stocks, 40% bonds), if stocks drop but bonds rise a little, how does the portfolio perform compared to 100% stocks?
